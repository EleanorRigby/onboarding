CF Onboarding Week contains two separate tracks: GCP and Local. The biggest difference is how you deploy your Cloud Foundry / Concourse environments, other than that they share many of the same stories. Choose the track that makes sense for your Onboarders based on the following differences:

**GCP Development**
*Ideal for Pivots whose jobs include BOSH / CF / Concourse deploys and troubleshooting*
* BOSH and BOSH Troubleshooting
* Deploying a full Cloud Foundry
* Deploying a full Concourse
* Experience with Google Cloud Platform

**Local Development**
*Ideal for Pivots with limited prior CF exposure*
* Faster to get up and running
* Use PCF Dev to explore the Cloud Foundry developer experience
* Use Concourse in a box (i.e. Vagrant or Docker) to explore Concourse
