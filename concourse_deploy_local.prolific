Deploy Concourse to BOSH
### What?
Okay, the training wheels are coming **off**. This Concourse deployment is gonna be just you + the same docs anyone else uses ("whhaaaaaat?" "I know, they grow up so fast!"). But first, a little preamble:

Concourse is a Pivotal-sponsored, pipeline-based continuous integration (CI) system. The "pipelines" are a collection of [three core concepts (jobs, tasks, and resources)](http://concourse.ci/concepts.html) that you'll learn more about in upcoming stories. While CI may call to mind test automation, Pivotal teams use it for so much more than that. Take a stroll around the office and checkout the jobs up on the CI screens to get a general idea of how broadly we use it to automate all that is automate-able.

### How?
Instead of deploying up a full Concourse, you're gonna _Easy Button_ your way out of it by **[spinning up a local VM with Vagrant](http://concourse.ci/vagrant.html)**.

### Expected Result
